iSpell was built with one thing in mind, to help kids learn their spelling words. Using a variety of different techniques your child will ace his spelling test, excel in a spelling bee, or simply improve his spelling skills.

At this time, there are four techniques used to help your child learn his or her spelling words, with more to come depending of the success of iSpell. The first technique is like your average spelling test, the word you record is played and the user, perhaps your child, enters the word. The second technique is similar to the first but instead you enter the word in backwards, really helps to drill down spelling. The third is to unscramble the letters given to you into the correct spelling word. And finally, the last way is your typical word search, a more fun way to learn spelling words.

Why is your kid going to love this app? Because it's fun and custom to you. You get to record all your words in whatever voice you like, there's no limit to how goofy you say it.

In addition to all this, you can have your child email there results to you, and see how they are doing. You can always add more lists, and edit the ones you already have.
